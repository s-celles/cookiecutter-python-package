# Tools Overview

This guide explains the importance of each tool included in this modern Python package template and how they work together to create a robust development environment.

## Core Philosophy

Modern Python development emphasizes:

- **Automation** - Reduce manual work and human error
- **Quality** - Consistent code style and early bug detection
- **Security** - Proactive security scanning
- **Collaboration** - Easy onboarding and contribution
- **Standards** - Following Python packaging best practices

## üéØ Recommended Tool Combinations

### Minimal Setup (Quick Start)
- pyproject.toml
- pytest
- Ruff
- Basic GitHub Actions

### Quality-Focused Setup
- All minimal tools +
- MyPy (type checking)
- Coverage (test coverage)
- pre-commit (automation)
- Bandit (security)

### Enterprise/Team Setup
- All quality tools +
- Dependabot (dependency updates)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Multiple environment testing (Tox/Nox)
- Advanced CI/CD pipelines

## üöÄ Getting Started Workflow

1. **Generate project**: `cookiecutter this-template`
2. **Choose tools**: Select based on your needs
3. **Set up environment**: Virtual environment + dependencies
4. **Configure IDE**: Type hints, linting integration
5. **Write code**: TDD approach with tests first
6. **Commit**: pre-commit hooks ensure quality
7. **Push**: CI runs comprehensive checks
8. **Release**: Automated publishing to PyPI

## üîÑ Daily Development Workflow

```bash
# Start development
make install-dev        # Install dependencies
make install-hooks      # Set up pre-commit

# During development
make test              # Run tests
make lint              # Check code quality
make format            # Fix formatting
make type-check        # Verify types

# Before committing
# (pre-commit runs automatically)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"

# CI automatically:
# - Tests on multiple Python versions
# - Checks code quality
# - Runs security scans
# - Updates documentation
```

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start simple**: Don't enable all tools immediately
2. **Learn gradually**: Add tools as you understand their value
3. **Customize**: Adapt configurations to your project needs
4. **Document**: Explain tool choices to your team
5. **Iterate**: Adjust tool configurations based on experience

## ü§ù Team Adoption

### For New Teams
- Start with minimal setup
- Add tools based on pain points
- Provide training on tool benefits
- Document team standards

### For Existing Projects
- Migrate gradually
- Run tools in "advisory" mode first
- Fix existing issues before enforcing
- Get team buy-in before strict enforcement

This modern toolchain transforms Python development from manual, error-prone processes into automated, high-quality workflows that scale with your project and team.
